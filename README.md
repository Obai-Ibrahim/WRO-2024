## INTRODUCTION
This Repository contains all the necessary information to build a self-driving car, which can complete three laps and handle different configurations of obstacles.
The code is written with Arduino C programming language, which controls the motor's movement based on the different sensors reading and mainly the information from the pixy cam.
The Repository contains an explanation of many aspects like the strategies and the power and mobility management. In the directory (other) many files will declare the calculation and the algorithms in a better way.
These files are:
Diagrams, DC motor, Power consumption and power supply, Driver.
